		<p>You are a renowned scientist in the field of elemental manipulation, researching a method that fuses the energy of all eight elements - earth, fire, wind, water, ice, electricity, light and dark matter - into a single entity to provide a source of renewable energy. In order to achieve this magnificent feat, you've built a new type of reactor, the likes of which the world has never seen.</p>
		<p>But your reactor is quite dangerous. It must be carefully and painstakingly attuned to each element, lest it explode and destroy the entire city (and it's surrounding environs)! Each element is attuned via a different method. Your first goal is to attune the chaotic element of fire.</p>

		<h2>Playing with Fire:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fire may be stablized by determining a randomly generated attunement level from 1-100.</li>
			<li>The reactor will hint to you whether you are close to the attunement level (red hot), far from it (ice cold), or somewhere in between.</li>
			<li>You have up to 5 guesses before the reactor explodes!</li>
